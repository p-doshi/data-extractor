I would like to thank you guys for the opportunity and this project
enhanced my skills and knowledge about a lot of things. I learnt a lot :)

1. Beautiful soup was something new to me, so I researched a bit
    on that and learned how to read from URLs. Text processing was
    fairly easy as it mainly dealt with reading and writing to files
    and basic functions whose math was already provided.


2. for easy working I have created to separate files
    one for reading text from the given url and
    other to process the text. If any changes are
    made to the URL texts I request please run the
    main.py again for the output folder to be updated.
    Then to check the analysis simply run the Text_processing
    file

3. pip install nltk
    pip install syllapy
    pip install openpyxl
    pip install pandas beautifulsoup4 requests
    I believe these are the only installations I made
    for this project that weren't already there on my device
